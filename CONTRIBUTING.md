### Contributions are welcome. AV testing, validation and certification are fast-moving areas and our intention is for MUSICC to be as useful a tool as possible.

# Bug reporting and feature suggestions

We use GitLab's [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/connected-places-catapult/musicc/-/issues) for bugs and feature requests. If there isn't already an issue for the bug or feature you're interested in, then please log a new one.

# Code contributions

Please look at the [roadmap](docs/Roadmap.md), or drop us an email, before starting work on a new contribution. 

# Contribution mechanics

New features or bug fixes should be submitted as a merge request for a new branch, which should be created to correspond to an issue in the tracker. The Connected Places Catapult maintains a build and test process for MUSICC internally, which enables us to pull this new branch into our internal repository, and ensure it is integrated and tested appropriately with the rest of the codebase.
