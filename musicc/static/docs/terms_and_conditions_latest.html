<li><p><strong>EVENTS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL</strong></p>
<ol type="1">

<li><p>If an Event Outside Our Control takes place that affects the performance of our obligations under this Licence:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>our obligations under this Licence will be suspended and the time for performance of our obligations will be extended for the duration of the Event Outside Our Control; and</p></li>
<li><p>we will use our reasonable endeavours to find a solution by which our obligations under this Licence may be performed despite the Event Outside Our Control.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We may transfer our rights and obligations under this Licence to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Licence.</p></li>
<li><p>You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under this Licence to another person if we agree in writing.</p></li>
<li><p>This Licence and any document expressly referred to in it constitutes the entire agreement between us and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between us, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter. You agree that you shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this Licence or any document expressly referred to in it. You agree that you shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in this in this Licence or any document expressly referred to in it.</p></li>
<li><p>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Licence, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the conditions of this Licence operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.</p></li>
<li><p>This Licence, its subject matter and its formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by English law. We both irrevocably agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales save that injunctive relief may be sought in any relevant jurisdiction.</p></li>
